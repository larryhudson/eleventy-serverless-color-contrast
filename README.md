# eleventy-serverless-color-contrast

This is a quick colour contrast utility I made with [Eleventy's new Serverless functions](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/).

I made this after seeing [Ben Myer's great demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wneO9XKkGTA).

You can check out the utility here:
